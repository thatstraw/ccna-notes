# ACL
ACLs (Acess Control Lists) have multiple uses
ACLS function as a packet filter, instructing the router to permit or discard specific traffic.
ACLs can filter traffic based on the source/destination IP address, source/destination Layer 4 ports etc.
Configuring an ACL in global config mode will not make the ACL take effect.
The ACL must be applied to an interface.
ACLs are applied either inbound or outbound
